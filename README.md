# PyVisca
Python library for controlling cameras through Visca protocol
---
This package is in alpha version, so be aware that everything can change before the beta.

It should work with python 2.7 and python 3.2, as theses are the requirements for pyserial which is an important dependancy as it is used to communicate with the camera.

I use a EVI H100S to develop this API. I hope to finish the development soon, and I will try to implement other VISCA cameras. I will start with EVI D70 as I own one.

This is an API, if you're looking for an application to control your camera, have a look at [Viscam](https://github.com/PixelStereo/viscam).

##QUICKSTART
* Run the example    

## Credits
